<p>This website contains the final project of group 9 for the course
  02806 Social Data Analysis & Visualization at DTU (2025). In this project we
  aim to analyze the temporal and geographical migration patterns of seven
  bird species in North America.</p>

<h3>Genre</h3>
<p>Initially we were looking to use the annotated chart and partitioned poster genres for our project. However, due to inspiration from the other team's introduction videos, we decided instead to follow a magazine style.</p>
