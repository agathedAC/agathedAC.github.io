    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The Canada Goose (<span class="italic">Branta canadensis</span>) is a familiar sight across North America, recognized by its black head and neck, white chinstrap, and brown body distinguishing it from all other goose species.</p>
      <p>It is a full migration waterbird, meaning a major portion of the population makes regular cyclical movements beyond its breeding range, with predictable timing and destinations.</p>
      <p>In terms of endangerment, the Canada Goose is considered as ‘least concern’ according to the IUCN Red List assessment as of 2018.</p>
      <p>It is native to the arctic and temperate regions of North America and can be found in some parts of Northern Europe, often found on or close to fresh water, the estuaries, and even urban areas, being so common in some suburban areas that many people consider them pests. During the summer it can mainly be found in Canada and northern parts of the United States, while primarily migrating to all of the United States during the winter.</p>
      <p>The overall population trend is increasing, undergoing a large, statistically significant increase over the last 40 years (from 2007) in Nort America (1500% increase over 40 years, equating to a 101% increase per decade). As of 2015, the global population is estimated at ca. 5.000.000-6.200.000 individuals (BirdLife International, 2018).</p>

        <p>The top location with the highest numbers of Canada Geese banded is in the United States, specifically in the [insert location] region. This pattern indicates significant migratory activity of the Canada Goose between [decades or time period, e.g., the 1970s and 2010s].</p>
