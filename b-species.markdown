    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The Canada Goose (<span class="italic">Branta canadensis</span>) is a familiar sight across North America, recognized by its black head and neck, white chinstrap, and brown body distinguishing it from all other goose species.</p>
      <p>It is a full migration waterbird, meaning a major portion of the population makes regular cyclical movements beyond its breeding range, with predictable timing and destinations.</p>
      <p>In terms of endangerment, the Canada Goose is considered as ‘least concern’ according to the IUCN Red List assessment as of 2018.</p>
      <p>It is native to the arctic and temperate regions of North America and can be found in some parts of Northern Europe, often found on or close to fresh water, the estuaries, and even urban areas, being so common in some suburban areas that many people consider them pests. During the summer it can mainly be found in Canada and northern parts of the United States, while primarily migrating to all of the United States during the winter.</p>
      <p>The overall population trend is increasing, undergoing a large, statistically significant increase over the last 40 years (from 2007) in Nort America (1500% increase over 40 years, equating to a 101% increase per decade). As of 2015, the global population is estimated at ca. 5.000.000-6.200.000 individuals (BirdLife International, 2018).</p>

        <h4>Overall Geographycal Patterns</h4>
        <p class="italic">The map below is interactive. Feel free to move around and zoom in and out!</p>
        <iframe src="/assets/species-geo-maps/CANADA_GOOSE_banding_map_with_geojson_us_ca.html" width="700" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p>The top location with the highest numbers of Canada Geese banded is in Northern America, specifically in the Ontario region of Canada. The map here also highlights the species' preference for bodies of water, showing gatherins along the coastlines of the United States and Canada. While the canda goose is known for staying relatively far north compared to other species, it is interesting to see the sprinkling of observations in southern United States, even Florida with a rather wet tropical climate compared to what the canada goose prefer. The smaller, but still significant number of occurences here may suggest that the species is beginning to go further south than before.</p>

        <h4>Temporal Changes between 1970s and 2010s</h4>

        <br>
        <p>The highest number of canada goose are banded in 2018 with count of 88638, whereas 1972 is the least banded year at 35335. While the difference here does not compare to the staggering 1500% increase from 1977-2007 the population numbers have seen, we still difinitely see a exponential increase over the years, which is in light with the increase in the species. This development is interesting seeing as many other bird species are seeing a decline in numbers.Unfortunately, looking at just the banding numbers over the years cannot tell us why this may be the case for the canda goose as opposed to other species.</p>
