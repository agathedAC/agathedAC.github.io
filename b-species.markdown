    <div>
      <p>The Canada Goose (Branta canadensis) is a familiar sight across North America, recognized by its black head and neck, white chinstrap, and brown body distinguishing it from all other goose species. It is native to the arctic and temperate regions of North America. It is primarily herbivorous, although they sometimes eat small insects and fish. and normally migratory; often found on or close to fresh water, the estuaries, and even urban areas, being so common in some suburban areas that many people consider them pests.It’s size range from 75 to 110 cm (30 to 43 in) in length and have a 127–185 cm (50–73 in) wingspan. The lifespan in the wild of geese who survive to adulthood ranges from 10 to 24 years. An interesting fact about this species is that it can sleep with one eye open, and can fly as high as 29,000 feet. It can have up to 25,000 feathers, Depending on the size and its plumage details, it widely varies as 7 subspecies, however, all are recognized as Canada geese. They tend to become smaller size as you move northward while plumage tends to become darker as you move westward (Wikipedia, Canada Goose, n.d.).</p>
