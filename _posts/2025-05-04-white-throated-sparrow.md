    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The White-throated Sparrow (<span class="italic">Zonotrichia albicollis</span>) is a medium-sized sparrow with a distinctive white throat patch and yellow lores (spots between the eyes and bill). They are known for their clear, whistled song.</p>
      <p>They are full migrant landbirds, meaning a major portion of the population makes regular cyclical movements beyond its breeding range, with predictable timing and destinations.</p>
      <p>In terms of endangerment, the tree swallow is considered as ‘least concern’ according to the IUCN Red List assessment as of 2021.</p>
      <p>They can be found in the northeast of the United States year-round, primarily breeding across Canada and migrating westward to California and south to southern North America during the winter.</p>
      <p>The global population trend has seen a moderate decline at an average of 1% per year from 1970 to 2017. Furthermore, short-term trends suggests that it since 2010 has declined 19% (BirdLife International, 2021b).</p>
