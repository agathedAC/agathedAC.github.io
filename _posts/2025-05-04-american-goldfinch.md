    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The American Goldfinch (<span class="italic">Spinus tristis</span>) is a small, vibrant yellow bird with black wings.</p>
      <p>They are full migrant landbirds, meaning a major portion of the population makes regular cyclical movements beyond its breeding range, with predictable timing and destinations.</p>
      <p>In terms of endangerment, the American Goldfinch is considered as ‘least concern’ according to the IUCN Red List assessment as of 2016.</p> 
      <p>They are native to temperate and subtropical/tropical dry parts of Nort America, primarily the United States and Mexico during the winter, most commonly seen in weedy fields and at backyard feeders (BirdLife International, 2016a).</p>
      <p>According to the North American Breeding Bird Survey, their numbers have decreased an estimated 0.6% per year between 1966 and 2019 for a cumulative decline of 27% (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, n.d.-a).</p>

        <h4>Overall Geographycal Patterns</h4>

        <p>As our map suggests, these birds are generally found all over Northearn America, primarily the northeast and along the western coast. They are quite popular at bird feeder station, which is likely why they some places appear to be congrgated around bigger cities on the map. It seems likely that as gobal warming continues and the temperature rises, they will be shifting more north for the more temperate area they primarily breed in (Audobon, 2024a).</p>

        <h4>Temporal Changes between 1970s and 2010s</h4>
        <img src="/figures/species-banding/american_goldfinch_banding_by_year.png" alt="american_goldfinch_banding_by_year"  class="graph-img">
        <p>Interestingly, the american goldfinch is the species whose banding events by year has the most natural looking pattern between the two decades. in the 2010s we do see the steady decline mentioned above, however, it appears that in the 70s the numbers may hve been more incusistent, but overall resulting in loss in the population over time. This is likely due to cliamte change and the onset of more wildfires that threaten their habitat, changes to food availability, and spring heat waves posing a danger to young birds (Audubon, 2024a).</p>
