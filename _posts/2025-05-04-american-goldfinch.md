    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The American Goldfinch (<span class="italic">Spinus tristis</span>) is a small, vibrant yellow bird with black wings.</p>
      <p>They are full migrant landbirds, meaning a major portion of the population makes regular cyclical movements beyond its breeding range, with predictable timing and destinations.</p>
      <p>In terms of endangerment, the American Goldfinch is considered as ‘least concern’ according to the IUCN Red List assessment as of 2016.</p> 
      <p>They are native to temperate and subtropical/tropical dry parts of Nort America, primarily the United States and Mexico during the winter, most commonly seen in weedy fields and backyard feeders.</p>
      <p>The overall population trend has been increasing, however, statistically insignificantly, over the last 40 years (from 2007) (BirdLife International, 2016a).</p>
