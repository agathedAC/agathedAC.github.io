    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The Gray Catbird (<span class="italic">Dumetella carolinensis</span>) is a medium-sized songbird with slate-gray plumage and a distinctive black cap. They are named for their cat-like "mew" call.</p>
      <p>They are full migrant landbirds, meaning a major portion of the population makes regular cyclical movements beyond its breeding range, with predictable timing and destinations.</p>
      <p>In terms of endangerment, the Gray Catbird is considered as ‘least concern’ according to the IUCN Red List assessment as of 2016.</p>
      <p>The Gray Catbird is native to temperate, subtropical/tropical moist and subtropical/tropical dry parts of North and Central America, particularly the United States during the summer, and migrating to Mexico and the Caribbean during the winter.</p>
      <p>The population trend has been stable over the last 40 years (from 2007) in North America (BirdLife International, 2016b).</p>
