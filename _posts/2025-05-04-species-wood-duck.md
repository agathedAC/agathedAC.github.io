    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The Wood Duck (<span class="italic">Aix sponsa</span>) is one of North America's most colorful waterfowl, with the males having a spectacularly colored plumage consisting of a glossy green head, chestnut colored breast, reddish bill, and red eyes. The females, on the other hand, have a brown plumage with a grey, slightly crested head, white rounded eye, and white along the edge of a dark blue speculum patch in the wings. They stand out from other ducks through their unique shape; a boxy, crested head, a thin neck, and a long, broad tail.</p>
      <p>They are full migrant waterbirds, meaning a major portion of the population makes regular cyclical movements beyond its breeding range, with predictable timing and destinations.</p>
      <p>In terms of endangerment, the wood duck is considered as ‘least concern’ according to the IUCN Red List assessment as of 2021.</p>
      <p>The wood duck is native to temperate climates, particularly near bodies of water such as marshes, freshwater lakes, rivers, creeks, and so forth, residing primarily in the United States in North America, migrating from northern to southern areas of the United States and western Caribbean during early fall.</p>
      <p>The global population overall increasing, currently estimated at around 4.600.000 mature individuals (BirdLife International, 2021a).</p>

        <h4>Overall Geographycal Patterns</h4>

        <p> For the wood duck, the highest concentrations of banding activity were observed in the U.S. subdivisions of Iowa (IA), Louisiana (LA), Illinois (IL), Minnesota (MN), and Wisconsin (WI). While not immediatly visible on our map, it is known that the wood duck has been decreasing in population near the east cost while increasing in the nothern part of the United States near the Great Lakes (BirdLife, 2021a), something which can be linked to the top subdivision being the state of Iowa in the US.</p>

        <h4>Temporal Changes between 1970s and 2010s</h4>

        <br>
        <p>The fewest wood duck banding events were recorded in 1973 at 17,513 with the majority of banding events conducted during the months of August and September.</p>
        <p>Similar to the canada goose, the wood duck is seeing a substantial increase in banding events between the 70s and 2010s. While it is not immediatly certain why that is the case for the canada goose, the population of the wood duck has increased due to the work of many people constructing wood duck boxes and conserving vital habitat for the wood ducks to breed. During the open waterfowl season, U.S. hunters have been allowed to take only two wood ducks per day in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways, highlighting how big an impact conservation efforts are as we are currently seeing an overall increase in their population (CITE).</p>
