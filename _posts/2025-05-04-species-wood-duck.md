    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The Wood Duck is one of North America's most colourful waterfowl, with the males having a spectacularly colored plumage consisting of a glossy green head, chestnut colored breast, reddish bill, and red eyes. The females, on the other hand, have a brown plumage with a grey, slightly crested head, white rounded eye, and white along the edge of a dark blue speculum patch in the wings. The stand out from other ducks through their unique shape; a boxy, crested head, a thin neck, and a long, broad tail. Typical adults are  47-54 cm in length with a wingspan of between 66-73 cm, with weights ranging from 454â€“862 grams. They generally feed by dabbling (feeding from the surface rather than diving underwater) or grazing on land where they mainly eat berries, acorns, and seeds, and insects, the latter of which makes them omnivores. Wood Ducks nest in tree cavities as they are adept at perching on branches, due to their sharp claws.</p>

        <h4>Temporal Changes between 1970s and 2010s</h4>
        <img src="/figures/species-banding/wood_duck_banding_by_year.png" alt="wood_duck_banding_by_year"  class="graph-img">
        <p>The fewest wood duck banding events were recorded in 1973 at 17,513. The population of the wood duck has increased due to the work of many people constructing wood duck boxes and conserving vital habitat for the wood ducks to breed. During the open waterfowl season, U.S. hunters have been allowed to take only two wood ducks per day in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways.</p>
        <p>The majority of banding events were conducted during the months of August and September. The most commonly used band types during this period include 41, 11, W1, and 01.The highest concentrations of banding activity were observed in the U.S. subdivisions of Iowa (IA), Louisiana (LA), Illinois (IL), Minnesota (MN), and Wisconsin (WI).</p>
