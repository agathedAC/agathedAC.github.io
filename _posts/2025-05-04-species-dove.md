    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The mourning dove (<span class="italic">Zenaida macroura</span>) is one of the most abundant and widespread North American birds, doubling as one of the most popular game bird species, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70 million in some years) shot annually in the U.S. They are all muted in color, generally light gray and brown with some pink, with broad wings, a rounded head, a long and tapered tail, and short, reddish colored feet.</p>
      <p>They are full migrant landbirds, meaning a major portion of the population makes regular cyclical movements beyond its breeding range, with predictable timing and destinations.</p>
      <p>In terms of endangerment, the mourning dove is considered as ‘least concern’ according to the IUCN Red List assessment as of 2024.</p>
      <p>It is native to temperate and subtropical/tropical dry areas of North America, specifically the United States and southern Canada, migrating to Central America, including Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda.</p>
      <p>The global population trend is currently seeing a slight negative trend, even though it had previously seen a small increase over the last 40 years (from 2007). In 2020 the total population in the Unted States and Canada was estimated to be around 130.000.000 mature individuals.</p>
      <p>The mourning dove is considered to have a medium dependency on forest habitat, and tree cover is estimated to have declined by 14.7% within its mapped range over the past three generations (Global Forest Watch 2022). North America holds the majority of the species' global range, and as such, the global population is considered to be decreasing slowly (BirdLife International, 2024).</p>

    <h3>Analysis of Migration Patterns</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Overall Geographycal Patterns</h4>
        <p class="italic">The map below is interactive. Feel free to move around and zoom in and out!</p>

        <p>Understandably, this species' occurence is much more sparce than that of the previous bird species, although it generally covers a much wider range geographically. This also highlgihts how its migration pattern seem to be fairly vertically linear. Its widespread reach could also explain why it is so highly impact both urbanization and increase in agriculture.</p>

        <h4>Temporal Changes between 1970s and 2010s</h4>
        <img src="/figures/species-banding/mourning_dove_banding_by_year.png" alt="mourning_dove_banding_by_year"  class="graph-img">
        <p>This graph highlights the sad trajectory of the population size of the mourning dove. The year with most mourning dove banding events is 1971 at 163649, while the year with fewest mourning dove banding events is 1978 at a count of 9835. While the 2010s see larger values than the late 70s, the former numbers are still significantly lower on average, and still seeing a slight decrease in the more recent years. The late 70s numbers could be due to the rapid increase in urbanization that was seen between 1940-1970 (Boustan et al., 2013), which as discussed previously is known to affect this species. </p>
