    <h3>About the Species</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The tree swallow (<span class="italic">Tachycineta bicolor</span>) is a small, agile bird with iridescent blue-green upperparts and white underparts. Thet primarily feed on flying insects and can drink and bathe while in flight.</p>
      <p>They are full migrant landbirds, meaning a major portion of the population makes regular cyclical movements beyond its breeding range, with predictable timing and destinations.</p>
      <p>In terms of endangerment, the tree swallow is considered as ‘least concern’ according to the IUCN Red List assessment as of 2016.</p>
      <p>It is typically found all across the continental U.S. (except the southeastern corner) and Canada, and in parts of Alaska, primarily near water and open fields. It usually migrates to Panama and other parts of Central America and the Caribbean in the winter.</p>
      <p>The species has had a stable population trend over the last 40 years (back-dating from 2007)(BirdLife International, 2016c), however, the numbers appear to now be declining faster than almost any other group of birds in North America, especially in the Northeast (Gross, 2019) where they are most common.</p>

        <h4>Overall Geographycal Patterns</h4>

        <p>The grouping of banding events shown on this map aligns with what we know about tree swallows; they primarily live in the northeastern part of the United States, though they can be found elsewhere as well. Interestingly, while these seem to overall be a decrease of the species where it usually lives, its numbers appears to be increasing in eastern Alaska, likely a result of the increasing temperatures globally (BirdLife International, 2016c).</p>

        <h4>Temporal Changes between 1970s and 2010s</h4>
        <img src="/figures/species-banding/tree_swallow_banding_by_year.png" alt="tree_swallow_banding_by_year"  class="graph-img">
        <br>
        <p>The year with most tree swallow banding events was 2012 at 30698, while the year with the fewest tree swallow banding events was 1970 at 5455. As we can see in our graph, the number of banding events seem to be declining in the latter part of the 2010s aligning with what professionals are saying about the population rates. One possible reason according to a study from southeastern Ontario, Canada, is climate change. They write that disruptions in spring weather patterns in the norteast due to climate change, is bringing more cold spells and rain. This affects several factors. Previous studies show that when songbirds lay their eggs early in response to rising tempepratures in the spring, they miss when insects, their primary source of sustenance and a need for babies to survive, is most abundant. Another emerging reason may be related to the increase in rainfall since the late 1970s. That is, when it rains many days in a row, insects are not flying around ehich in turns mean the babies do not get any sustenance when they should be ready to fledge while also being cold due to the cold weather. Together, this is a death sentence for a newly hatched baby bird (Gross, 2019).</p>
