<h2>Temporal changes in Migration Patterns</h2>
<div>
    <h3>About the Changes</h3>
    <p>Each spring, more than 450 species of birds set out to fly thousands of kilometres from their wintering station to breeding grounds farther north. And each fall, they make the trip back to more welcoming environments to spend winter in. This migration is mainly caused by the rarefication of food sources in the north with the coming of winter. Under this paragraph you can see a map of the banding, recapturing and sighting locations of birds throughout the year.</p>

        <h4>Flyaways</h4>
        <p>There are four main pathways used by birds to migrate. From east to west, we find first the Atlantic flyway that spans from the Atlantic coast roughly to the Appalachian Mountains. Then we can find the Mississippi flyway, one of the most used one, that follow the path of the Mississippi river. Next to it we have the Central flyway, bounded at west by the Rocky Mountains. Finally, the Pacific flyway follows the Pacific coast of the United States. 
        Birds usually avoid flying across mountains, as they would have to fly higher, endure the cold and food is rarer in those regions. This explain the void in the middle west side of the United States on the following map, as it is where lie the Rocky mountains.

        <p>As we can see on those maps, spring and fall migrations are very different. Scientists noticed that the spring migration is usually faster than in the fall. One hypothesis to explain it is that there is a competition in the spring to arrive to the breeding grounds first, to secure a good territory for reproduction. We can also note that the fall migration includes youngsters born in the summer, less efficient to find food during restauration stops, and less endurant than adults, so needing more and longer rests. Some species (not the ones studied here) are even known to use different routes during migrations, flying across the ocean in the spring and across the land in the fall. </p>

        <h4>Non migratory birds</h4>
        <p>However, not all birds migrate. In fact, with the global warming, the need for migration becomes less and less present as birds are able to find food year-round under some latitudes. From the middle to the north of United States, most birds are permanent residents, wintering and breeding on the same grounds. You can notice it on the following two heatmaps, where summer display a shift towards the north compared to winter. </p>

        <p>Here the plots show the repartition of the birds banding, recapture and sighting events following their country location during the seventies and during the 2010s. Canada is usually too cold for birds to stay there year-round, which is why there is a large increase in the share of events in Canada during summer. The increased share of events in Canada from the seventies to the 2010s is probably due to an increase of bird studies in Canada during this period. What is interesting to notice here is the shift of the peak of events in Canada from July to May. This is likely due to global warming that causes spring to arrive earlier in cold regions and consequently pushes birds to migrate earlier in the season.</p>

        <h4>Temporal comparisons on species</h4>
        <p>In the following two graphs, we can compare for each specie the number of events per month, during the seventies and during the 2010s. We notice that the trends are the same between the two decades for each species. It is quite reassuring, as we can infer that even with global warming and the destruction of some natural environments, there was no big changes in their behaviour during this period. Some species have two peaks of events in a year, those are probably easier to catch during migration, and the rest seems to be more found during the breeding or post-breeding season (maybe the youngsters are less suspicious than the adults?). The Canada Goose are particularly successful at cohabiting with humans, sometimes living in the cities and eating in dumpsters. We indeed notice on the 2010s plot a large increase of events concerning this specie. They are thriving so much that we are considering them an invasive specie.  </p>
