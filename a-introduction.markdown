        <h4>North American Bird Migration Analysis (1970s vs. 2010s)</h4>
        <div class="quote-box">
            <p>"<span class="quote">Birds are indicators of environmental health for their own species, people, and other wildlife.</span>" - Dayer, associate professor in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation at Virginia Tech (Ashburn, 2024).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Experts say that recent data suggests bird populations in North America have seen <span style="font-weight: bold">a loss of more than 1 in 4 birds since 1970</span>. That's <span style="font-weight: bold">approximatelt 2.9 billion birds</span>, a finding from the first-ever comprehensible assessment of the net population changes of birds in the United States and Canada (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2019). Some of the major reasons for this include, but is not limited to, habitat loss caused by agricultural intensification, urbanization, and climate change. 1 billion birds are found to die each year just from collision with windows alone, a direct result of increased urbanization (Ashburn, 2024).</p>
        <p>This trend is happening amongst birds in every biome. Forest birds have seen a decline of 1 billion birds. Grassland birds have collectively declined around 53% or 720 million birds. What's more, <span style="font-weight: bold">the greatest losses are seen amongst the most common birds</span>, from popular sights in bird feeders such as white-throated sparrows, to common sightings in nature, such as the red-winged blackbird. <span style="font-weight: bold">More than 90% if the overall losses are from just 12 families of common species</span>, including sparrows, blackbirds, warblers, and finches (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2019).</p>
        <p>As such, this project aims to see if <span style="font-weight: bold">bird migration patterns in North America</span> between the <span style="font-weight: bold">1970s and the 2010s</span>, using data collected from the <a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/653fa806d34ee4b6e05bc57d">U.S. Geological Survey ScienceBase Catalog</a> will show us a similar story, <span style="font-weight: bold">determining if bird banding is a useful tool in the analysis of bird trends caused by external factors such as agriculture expansion, urbanization, and climate change.</span></p>

        <h4>Focus Species</h4>
        <p>We focus on <span style="font-weight: bold">seven bird species</span> selected for their diversity, abundance of records, and their grouping within the dataset:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Canada Goose</li>
            <li>Wood Duck</li>
            <li>Mourning Dove</li>
            <li>Tree Swallow</li>
            <li>Gray Catbird</li>
            <li>American Goldfinch</li>
            <li>White-throated Sparrow</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To streamline the analysis, we retained only the data from <span style="font-weight: bold">1970 and 2010</span>, allowing for a clear comparison of migration patterns across these two decades. Each specie family in the dataset encompassed several species, so to main bias and to get a more streamlined overview, we chose to focus on one species from each family. Each of the chosen species furthermore has a good amount of data for analysis.</p>

    <div>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand how <span style="font-weight: bold">migration patterns have changed</span> temporally.</li>
            <li>Better understand <span style="font-weight: bold">the dynamcis of migration generally</span>.</li>
            <li>Compare patterns and trends between the <span style="font-weight: bold">1970s and 2010s</span>.</li>
            <li>Analyze <span style="font-weight: bold">if bird banding data shows the same trends</span> as that of professional findings.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Importance of Bird Banding</h4>
        <p><span class="italic">The North American Bird Banding Program (NABBP)</span>, administered by the <span class="italic">U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Bird Banding Laboratory</span> and the <span class="italic">Canadian Wildlife Service's Bird Banding Office</span>, uses standardized event types to categorize different bird banding activities.</p>
        <p>For some context, bird banding in North America was first introduced in 1803 by John James Audubon, who tied silver wire around the legs of nestling eastern phoebes, two of which returned the following spring. Later on in 1882 Ernest Thompson Seton used printer's ink to mark snow buntings. In 1996, the North American Banding Council (NABC) was formed. Their mission was to train banders in safe, ethical practices of the capture and handling of wild birds (Wikipedia, 2021).</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Studies of bird migration are crucial. Modern bird banding efforts support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Research</span> on avian behavior, ecology, and population dynamics</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Conservation</span> of endangered species</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Regulation of hunting</span> for game birds</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Human health and safety initiatives</span> (e.g., monitoring West Nile virus, preventing bird strikes near airports)</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Results from banding activities also contribute to international conservation programs such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Partners in Flight</li>
            <li>North American Waterfowl Management Plan</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What is Migration</h4>
        <p>Migration is categorized as the seasonal or cyclical movement pattern of a particular species, not limited to birds but also other animals. Generally, four types of migration are utilized to categorize a species' migration patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full migrant</li>
            <li>Altitudinal migrant</li>
            <li>Nomadic</li>
            <li>Not a migrant</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Full migrant</span> species means a major part of the global or regional population partakes in seasonal cyclical movements beyond their breeding range, usually with predictable timing and destinations. It furthermore includes species that may only be partially migratory, only partake in short-distance migration, or respond to unusual conditions, such as deforestation or fires, in semi-nomadic ways. These kind of species may need conservation actions along their migration routes. <span style="font-weight: bold">Altitudinal migrant</span> species, on the ohter hand, regularly make cyclical movements from and to highler and lower elevations, rather than distance, with predictable timing and destinations. <span style="font-weight: bold">Nomadic</span> species moves due to resources being sporadic in time and distribution. They may congregate at specific locations, but this is not predictable in terms of location and timing. Finally, if a species is <span style="font-weight: bold">not a migrant</span>, it means they neither partake in nomradic or migratory patterns of any kind. It is also possible that a species' pattern is not known, however, nowadays this is increasingly rare (Birdlife, 2024).</p>
        <p>In this project we have chosen to only focus on full migrant bird species, as we are interested in how these migration patterns may have changed over time.</p>

    <h3>Introductory statistics</h3>
    <p>The dataset contains 7 species, with the canada goose having the highest occurences at 1284279 while the least occuring bird is the tree swallow. In the datset NABBP categorized two types of events B (banding) and E (encounter), where B indicates the initial banding event, where a bird is captured and a band is applied for the first time, and E represents a subsequent encounter with a previously banded bird. Encounters can occur through various means, such as recapture, resighting, or recovery. To band the species they used 25 different band types used based on their gender, age, size and location, among those bands, type 11 and 41 are mostly used.</p>
    <p>The year with most bird band events conducted was 1971 at 299230 bandings, while the year with the fewest bird band events was 1977 at 175587 bandings. </p>
    <p>The most migrated countries are United States (US) and Canada (CA) in given period. Bird baded events are conducted several locations and they grouped to become a subdivions. The highest bird banded events was conducted in Canada in Ontario (CA-ON) and in US, New York (NY). Ontario is Canada's most populous province and a major location for bird banding activities due to its diverse habitats, including forests, wetlands, and large migratory corridors along the Great Lakes. New York is a key state for bird banding due to its strategic location along the Atlantic Flyway, a major migratory route for many bird species.</p>
    <div>
        <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
        <p>To begin with data collection we used 7 csv files from <a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/653fa806d34ee4b6e05bc57d" target="_blank">ScienceBase</a>, which include data from 1970 to 2023. To reduce the data size, we focused on the 1970s and 2010s decennies and 7 focus species. As part of the cleaning process, we dropped duplicates and chose to keep data entries with less than 20% missing values. It should be noted we kept data entries with null values in features we will not be looking at, such as age. The "event date" and "band type" features, which we primarily focus on, are both cleaned for analysis.</p>

        <h4>Overall Bird Distribution Changes from 1970s to 2010s</h4>
        <p class="italic">The graph below is interactive. You can highlight each decade by clicking on the name in the legend.</p>
        <iframe src="/assets/intro/bird_banding_by_species_and_decade3.html" width="700" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p>As we'll learn in the introductory section on <a href="/species/">canada goose</a>, the increase in canda goose bindings from the 70s to the 10s allign with the increadible increase in the species we have seen over th elast decades. Similarly, the <a href="/species-mourning-dove/">mourning dove</a> and the <a href="/species-white-throated-sparrow/">white-throated sparrow</a> have both seen decreases in their populations over the last decades, which likewise is reflected here in the banding comparisons between the decades. This suggests that while banding numbers and actual bird population numbers are not going to be the same values, due to not all birds being banded, the trend of these numbers over time seem to follow each other.</p>

        <p>This map gives us an introductory glimpse at where our seven chosen species' can generally be observed. It should be noted that since this dataset originated from the United States, the lower numbers of banding events in other countries in North America, is not neccesarily due to less banding efforts, but rather likely due to less focus on these areas from professionals as they work for the US government. The higher numbers of observations in Canada is likely due to the close relations between <span class="italic">the North American Bird Banding Program (NABBP)</span> and the <span class="italic">Canadian Wildlife Service's Bird Banding Office</span>. We will be going more in depth on the specific species patterns and migration in later sections.</p>

        <h4>Temporal change between 1970s and 2010s</h4>
        <p class="italic">The graph below is interactive. You can highlight each species by selecting and deselecting them in the legend.</p>
        <iframe src="/assets/intro/temproal_changes_of_bird_banding_events2.html" width="700" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p>While the general population trend of birds in North America is seeing a downward trend, this graph highlights the efforts to stabilize efforts of conservation and data collection. The 70s being the second to first decade of the dataset highlights an inconsistency in banding over the years, while the 2010s show a much more consistend trend for each species. This speaks to the evolution of conservation practices in North America and highlights that it is unlikely that the downward trend we are seeing in population numbers is simply due to something like neglience of data collection and analysis.</p>
