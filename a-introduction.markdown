    <h3>About the project</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>North American Bird Migration Analysis (1970s vs. 2010s)</h4>
        <p><span class="italic">The North American Bird Banding Program (NABBP)</span>, administered by the <span class="italic">U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Bird Banding Laboratory</span> and the <span class="italic">Canadian Wildlife Service's Bird Banding Office</span>, uses standardized event types to categorize different bird banding activities.</p>
        <p>For some context, bird banding in Nort America was first introduced in 1803 by John James Audubon, who tied silver wire around the legs of nestling eastern phoebes, two of which returned the following spring. Later on in 1882 Ernest Thompson Seton used printer's ink to mark snow buntings. In 1996, the North American Banding Council (NABC) was formed. Their mission was to train banders in safe, ethical practices of the capture and handling of wild birds.</p>
        <p>This project aims to analyze <span style="font-weight: bold">bird migration patterns in North America</span> between the <span style="font-weight: bold">1970s and the 2010s</span>, using data collected from the <a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/653fa806d34ee4b6e05bc57d">U.S. Geological Survey ScienceBase Catalog</a>.</p>

        <h4>Focus Species</h4>
        <p>We focus on <span style="font-weight: bold">seven bird species</span> selected for their diversity, abundance of records, and their grouping within the dataset:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Canada Goose</li>
            <li>Wood Duck</li>
            <li>Mourning Dove</li>
            <li>Tree Swallow</li>
            <li>Gray Catbird</li>
            <li>American Goldfinch</li>
            <li>White-throated Sparrow</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To streamline the analysis, we retained only the data from <span style="font-weight: bold">1970 and 2010</span>, allowing for a clear comparison of migration patterns across these two decades. Each specie family in the dataset encompassed several species, so to main bias and to get a more streamlined overview, we chose to focus on one species from each family. Each of the chosen species furthermore has a good amount of data for analysis.</p>

        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand how <span style="font-weight: bold">migration patterns have changed</span> temporally and geographically.</li>
            <li>Identify <span style="font-weight: bold">the number of birds banded</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">the banding events</span>, and their <span style="font-weight: bold">subdivisions</span>.</li>
            <li>Compare patterns and trends between the <span style="font-weight: bold">1970s and 2010s</span>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Importance of Bird Banding</h4>
        <p>Studies of bird migration are crucial. Modern bird banding efforts support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research on avian behavior, ecology, and population dynamics</li>
            <li>Conservation of endangered species</li>
            <li>Regulation of hunting** for game birds</li>
            <li>Human health and safety initiatives (e.g., monitoring West Nile virus, preventing bird strikes near airports)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Results from banding activities also contribute to international conservation programs such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Partners in Flight</li>
            <li>North American Waterfowl Management Plan</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Overall Bird Distribution Changes from 1970s to 2010s</h4>
        <img src="/figures/canada_goose.jpg" alt="Canada Goose" class="image">
        <p>The dataset contains 7 species with 23 features. Among the 7 species Canada Goose is the highest population with (1284279) and least bird is Tree Swallow. NABBP conducted 2 types of events B:Banding and E: Encounter where B indicates the initial banding event, where a bird is captured and a band is applied for the first time, E: Encounter represents a subsequent encounter with a previously banded bird. Encounters can occur through various means, such as recapture, resighting, or recovery.To band the species they used 25 different band types used based on their gender, age, size and location and band type. All focus species are migrated countries are United States (US) and Canada (CA) in given period.</p>

        <h4>Overall Geographical Data (Potentially also changes from 1970s to 2010s)</h4>
        <img src="/figures/canada_goose.jpg" alt="Canada Goose" class="image">
        <p>Bird baded events are conducted several locations, Under one subdivions covers many locations with (LAT_DD and LOG_DD). The highest bird banded events conducted in Canada in Ontarion (CA-ON) and in US is New York (NY).Ontario is Canada's most populous province and a major location for bird banding activities due to its diverse habitats, including forests, wetlands, and large migratory corridors along the Great Lakes. New York is a key state for bird banding due to its strategic location along the Atlantic Flyway, a major migratory route for many bird species.</p>

        <h4>Example of temporal change between 1970s and 2010s (Especially important to support our thesis)</h4>
        <img src="/figures/canada_goose.jpg" alt="Canada Goose" class="image">
        <p>The bird banded events conducted rate changed each year which indicates the increased or decreased population of that specific specie. However the overal the bird count increased on avarage. The most birds were banded in 1971 with 299230 and the lowest number birds banded in 1977 with count of 175,587.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Bird banded events conducted by North American Bird Banding Program (NABBP) where it tag color band around bird's neck or to legs according to their age, weight, gender, sepecies family to identify them in migration process. In this we focued on seven north amrican birds to analyse their migration patterns, geographical changes, temporal changes of the bird band events conducted in 1970 ans 2010s . Among the 7 species Canada Goose is the highly banded bird in selected period.</p>
